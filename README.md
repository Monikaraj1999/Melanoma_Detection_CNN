# Melanoma Skin Cancer Detection
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
> In the skin biopsy, the dermatologist takes some part of the skin lesion and examines it under the microscope. The current process takes almost a week or more, starting from getting a dermatologist appointment to getting a biopsy report. The aims to shorten the current gap to just a couple of days by providing the predictive model. The approach uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify nine types of skin cancer from outlier lesions images. This reduction of a gap has the opportunity to impact millions of people positively.

## General Information
- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).
- All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC.
- The data set contains the following diseases:

Actinic keratosis,
Basal cell carcinoma,
Dermatofibroma,
Melanoma,
Nevus,
Pigmented benign keratosis,
Seborrheic keratosis,
Squamous cell carcinoma and
Vascular lesion.

## Conclusions
- Accuracy on training data has increased by using Augmentor library and also class imbalance is handled well.
- Model can be further improved by tuning the hyperparamter.
- The final model is able to predict the class accurately.
